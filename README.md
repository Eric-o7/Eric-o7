## Hi, I'm Eric Brown ðŸ‘‹

In the past year I have learned Python, Go, and Javascript.

I have a technical background in electronics engineering through my time in the US Navy, and years of professional experience in business operations. Though I don't have professional experience in programming, I believe my background does lend itself to the mindset of a successful programmer. I'm currently looking for a role in backend development, ideally using Go or Python. I'd especially love to work on a team where I can find mentorship and continue my understanding and capabilities in the great world of programming.

ðŸ‘¯I created a Text-based RPG in Python from conception to conclusion as my first major project. https://github.com/Eric-o7/Play_Dead

ðŸŒ±I will be working with Go, SQL, and Docker for my next project.
